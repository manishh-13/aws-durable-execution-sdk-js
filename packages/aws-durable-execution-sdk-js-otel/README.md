# AWS Durable Execution SDK - OpenTelemetry Plugin

> **Experimental beta:** This plugin is not recommended for production
> workloads. Its API may change between releases.

OpenTelemetry instrumentation for the AWS Durable Execution SDK. The package
provides two plugins that emit Workflow, Invocation, durable operation, and
operation-attempt spans.

The whole durable execution shares **one trace**, anchored at the execution
ancestor resolved at invocation start. The `Workflow` span and every per-invocation
`Invocation` span join that trace, so a single trace ID spans all invocations of
the execution.

They differ in where durable operation spans are parented:

| Plugin                 | Operation hierarchy                  | Cross-link                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `ExecutionOtelPlugin`  | `Workflow -> operation -> attempt`   | Operations and attempts link Invocation |
| `InvocationOtelPlugin` | `Invocation -> operation -> attempt` | Operations and attempts link Workflow   |

The plugins do not create or register an OpenTelemetry provider, exporter,
sampler, resource, propagator, context manager, or library instrumentation.
They use the global provider by default, or an application-owned provider
created through `tracerProviderFactory`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @aws/durable-execution-sdk-js-otel \
            @aws/durable-execution-sdk-js \
            @opentelemetry/api \
            @opentelemetry/core \
            @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node
```

The package requires Node.js 22 or later. Exporters, span processors,
propagators, resources, and library instrumentation are application or ADOT
responsibilities.

## Quick Start

When an SDK provider is registered globally, no plugin configuration is
required:

```typescript
import { withDurableExecution } from "@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js";
import { ExecutionOtelPlugin } from "@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js-otel";

const plugin = new ExecutionOtelPlugin();

export const handler = withDurableExecution(
  async (event, context) => {
    return context.step("process", async () => process(event));
  },
  { plugins: [plugin] },
);
```

Use `InvocationOtelPlugin` instead when operations should appear under each
Lambda invocation rather than under the durable Workflow.

## Provider Setup

### Global Provider

Omitting `tracerProviderFactory` uses `trace.getTracerProvider()`. This is the
normal setup for the ADOT Lambda layer, OpenTelemetry zero-code
instrumentation, or an application that registers its own provider globally.

When using ADOT, activate its instrumentation wrapper:

```text
AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-instrument
```

The OpenTelemetry JavaScript API does not provide a public way to retrieve or
replace a provider's configured ID generator. For a compatible SDK tracer, the
plugin therefore:

1. reads the tracer's runtime `_idGenerator` field;
2. replaces it with a guarded deterministic wrapper;
3. delegates all ID generation outside plugin span creation to the original
   generator.

This private-field integration is isolated behind runtime shape and assignment
checks. It does not change IDs for unrelated spans, including spans created
concurrently or with the same instrumentation scope.

If the plugin is constructed before the SDK provider is globally registered,
its initial tracer may be a proxy without `_idGenerator`. At each invocation
start, the plugin re-resolves the global provider until a compatible SDK tracer
is available. When installation still fails:

- plugin telemetry and log enrichment are disabled for that invocation;
- a warning is emitted;
- provider resolution is retried on the next invocation.

Providers or future SDK tracers that do not expose the compatible runtime field
cannot use this global-provider path. Use `tracerProviderFactory` to install the
generator through the supported provider constructor API.

### Application-Owned Provider

`tracerProviderFactory` receives a function that creates the plugin's
deterministic ID wrapper. The factory is called during plugin construction.

```typescript
import { InvocationOtelPlugin } from "@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js-otel";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http";
import {
  NodeTracerProvider,
  SimpleSpanProcessor,
} from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node";

const plugin = new InvocationOtelPlugin({
  tracerProviderFactory: (createIdGenerator) => {
    const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
      idGenerator: createIdGenerator(),
      spanProcessors: [
        new SimpleSpanProcessor(
          new OTLPTraceExporter({
            url: "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
          }),
        ),
      ],
    });

    provider.register();
    return provider;
  },
});
```

`createIdGenerator()` delegates non-durable IDs to OpenTelemetry's standard
random generator. To preserve another generator, pass it as the fallback:

```typescript
idGenerator: createIdGenerator(applicationIdGenerator);
```

The deterministic override is active only for the synchronous `startSpan()`
call made by the plugin. All unrelated IDs use the fallback generator.

The application owns the returned provider and all associated configuration:

- exporters and span processors;
- sampling and resources;
- context management and propagation;
- HTTP, AWS SDK, Lambda, and other library instrumentation;
- global registration;
- shutdown.

The provider does not have to be the global provider for the plugin to obtain a
tracer from it. Register it globally when the application also needs its
context manager, propagator, or library instrumentation.

At the end of each enabled invocation, both plugins call `forceFlush()` when
the provider exposes it. They never call `shutdown()`.

## Dynamic Loading from a Lambda Layer

The SDK can load either plugin without importing it in function code. Package
this module and its peer dependencies in a Lambda layer under
`nodejs/node_modules`, then configure one entry point:

```text
DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS=@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js-otel/otel-execution
```

or:

```text
DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS=@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js-otel/otel-invocation
```

Dynamic providers construct plugins with default configuration, so they
require a compatible globally registered SDK provider. Use code-based
registration when `tracerProviderFactory` or other custom configuration is
needed.

## Choosing a Plugin

### `ExecutionOtelPlugin`

Use this plugin for a workflow-centered view. Operations and attempts are
children of the `Workflow` span. Each also links to the `Invocation` span that
observed it. The whole execution shares one trace.

```text
Execution trace

Execution ancestor
├── Workflow
│   └── Operation: fetch-data
│       └── Attempt 1
└── Invocation

Links:
Operation -> Invocation
Attempt   -> Invocation
```

The plugin makes Workflow the active span while durable handler code runs.
Completed operation spans use durable operation start/end timestamps and
deterministic span IDs. An operation that remains open when an invocation
suspends is not ended or exported; a later invocation recreates and exports it
with the **same deterministic span ID on the same execution trace** when the
operation completes. That reproducible ID is how the segments of one logical
operation stay stitched together across invocations — no cross-invocation link
is needed, unlike `InvocationOtelPlugin` below.

### `InvocationOtelPlugin`

Use this plugin for an invocation-centered view. Operations and attempts are
children of the current `Invocation` span. Each links to the `Workflow` span.
The whole execution shares one trace.

```text
Execution trace

Execution ancestor
├── Workflow
└── Invocation
    └── Operation: fetch-data
        └── Attempt 1

Links:
Operation -> Workflow
Attempt   -> Workflow
```

The plugin makes Invocation the active span while durable handler code runs.
Open operation spans are ended at the invocation boundary and retain
`durable.operation.status=STARTED`. When an operation completes in a later
invocation, the plugin emits a continuation span in that invocation.

Because the original span context is not checkpointed, replayed `STEP` and
`CONTEXT` spans and cross-invocation continuation spans use new provider IDs.
They correlate through two links: the real exported `Workflow` span, and the
**initial logical operation span** — whose ID is deterministic on
`(operationId, execution ARN)` and lives on the execution trace, so the segments
of one logical operation stay stitched together across invocations. Replay-only
`WAIT`, `INVOKE`, `CHAINED_INVOKE`, and `CALLBACK` operations are not emitted
again.

## Execution Trace and the Execution Ancestor

Both plugins resolve one **execution ancestor** at invocation start — the common
parent the `Workflow` and `Invocation` spans join — so the whole execution
shares a single trace. The ancestor is chosen by precedence:

1. a **complete propagated remote parent** (a valid `Root` trace ID and a valid
   `Parent` span ID): used directly, whether or not `Sampled` is present;
2. otherwise a **synthetic execution root** with a deterministic span ID derived
   from the execution ARN.

The canonical trace ID follows the same precedence: the propagated remote trace
ID when valid, else one derived from the ARN and start time.

A live ambient span (a `context.active()` span created by an auto-instrumentation
layer) is deliberately **never** used as the execution ancestor. Its trace ID is
not guaranteed stable across Lambda reinvocations, so anchoring the
multi-invocation execution on it could change the execution trace ID on replay
and break the cross-invocation continuation and replay links (which target a
deterministic operation span ID on the canonical trace). Both anchors used above
are stable: the durable backend keeps the propagated `Root` identical for every
invocation, and the ARN-derived synthetic root is a pure hash of the ARN.

### Valid Workflow parent shapes

`ADOT` and community Node.js auto-instrumentation layers can create the ambient
handler span before the durable plugin runs, on the trace the durable backend
propagated. OpenTelemetry `SpanContext` has no ancestor pointer, so the plugin
cannot walk from that local span to the durable backend span. The `Workflow`
span therefore joins the canonical trace and parents onto whichever ancestor the
precedence above resolves. When a complete remote parent is propagated, that is
the ancestor:

```text
Propagated remote parent
├── Workflow
└── Invocation
```

When no complete remote parent can be constructed, the synthetic execution root
anchors the trace and the `Workflow` span parents onto it:

```text
Synthetic execution root
└── Workflow
```

The `Invocation` span may still nest under a same-trace ambient handler span —
see [Invocation parent](#invocation-parent) — without changing the execution
ancestor the `Workflow` span joins.

### Workflow identity and lifecycle

`Workflow` is an `INTERNAL` span that **joins the execution trace** by parenting
onto the execution ancestor (its span ID is forced; the trace ID comes from the
parent). Its span ID is reproducible across replays:

- span ID: the first 16 hexadecimal characters of SHA-256 over
  `workflow:<execution ARN>`.

The synthetic execution root, when used, gets a distinct deterministic span ID
from SHA-256 over `execution-root:<execution ARN>`, and the ARN-derived trace ID
is the first 32 hexadecimal characters of SHA-256 over
`<execution ARN>:<execution start timestamp in ISO 8601 format>` (falling back
to the ARN alone when the timestamp is unavailable).

The plugins create the same `Workflow` span identity on each invocation, but end
and export it only when the execution reaches `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`. Workflow
spans created for `PENDING` or `RETRYING` invocations are left unended and are
therefore not exported. This produces one exported `Workflow` span for the
durable execution while intermediate invocation spans export normally.

When a chained parent and target execution share a propagated remote parent,
both join that one trace, each keeping its own deterministic `Workflow` span ID.

### Invocation parent

The `Invocation` span parents onto the **same-trace ambient span** when one is
active on the canonical trace (preserving the Lambda/X-Ray linkage), otherwise
onto the execution ancestor so it stays on the execution trace. Provider
ownership does not change this topology.

### Sampling

Sampling follows this precedence, highest first:

1. **Execution-stable upstream decision** — an explicit `Sampled=1` /
   `Sampled=0` in an execution-stable propagated header is authoritative and
   preserved. The default X-Ray extractor marks its result execution-stable;
   custom extractors must explicitly opt in with `isExecutionStable: true`.
2. **Deterministic configured sampler** — when the header carries no usable
   decision, deterministic provider samplers (`AlwaysOnSampler`,
   `AlwaysOffSampler`, `TraceIdRatioBasedSampler`, and `ParentBasedSampler`
   compositions of those samplers) decide. They are evaluated at their **root
   policy** (`ROOT_CONTEXT`, no parent) with the real trace ID, span name, and
   attributes, so a `ParentBasedSampler` applies its `root` sampler rather than
   inheriting an unrelated ambient span's decision, and a trace-ID-ratio sampler
   is stable across reinvocations.
3. **Default to sampled** — used when no sampler decision can be obtained or the
   configured sampler is custom/stateful. Consulting a stateful or quota sampler
   independently on different Lambda environments could split one durable
   execution into a partial trace, so undecided execution sampling defaults to
   the stable OTel/ADOT root behavior (`parentbased_always_on`).

The resolved execution decision is enforced for all SDK-created spans through a
durable sampler wrapper around the provider sampler. This makes explicit backend
sampling authoritative even for direct/custom samplers that ignore parent
`traceFlags`. Unrelated application spans still use the original configured
sampler. If the resolved tracer does not expose a compatible writable sampler,
the plugin disables tracing for that invocation and emits a warning rather than
exporting spans whose sampling decision cannot be enforced.

### Context extractors

The default `xRayContextExtractor` parses `Root`, `Parent`, and `Sampled`
independently from `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID`, rejecting an all-zero (invalid) `Root` or
`Parent`. It marks its result execution-stable because the durable backend keeps
the X-Ray `Root` stable for every invocation of one execution. The package also
exports `w3cClientContextExtractor`, which reads W3C `traceparent` data from
`context.clientContext.custom.traceparent`; that context is not automatically
treated as an execution-stable anchor.

A custom extractor can return:

```typescript
type Sampling = "SAMPLED" | "NOT_SAMPLED" | "UNDECIDED";

type ContextExtractor = (info: InvocationInfo) =>
  | {
      traceId: string;
      parentSpanId?: string;
      traceFlags?: number;
      sampling?: Sampling;
      isExecutionStable?: boolean;
    }
  | undefined;
```

A complete remote parent needs `isExecutionStable: true`, a valid `traceId`, and
a valid `parentSpanId`. `sampling` is the tri-state upstream decision; when
omitted it is derived from `traceFlags` (sampled bit), and when neither is
present the decision is `UNDECIDED` and the deterministic sampling rules above
decide. Extracted sampling is ignored unless the extracted trace ID is marked
execution-stable, because invocation-scoped upstream context could change on a
later replay and split one durable execution across traces.

## Shared Configuration

Both plugins accept `OtelPluginConfig`:

```typescript
interface OtelPluginConfig {
  /** Creates an application-owned provider with a deterministic ID wrapper. */
  tracerProviderFactory?: (
    createIdGenerator: (fallbackIdGenerator?: IdGenerator) => IdGenerator,
  ) => TracerProvider;

  /** Extracts upstream trace context. Defaults to xRayContextExtractor. */
  contextExtractor?: ContextExtractor;

  /** Instrumentation scope name. */
  instrumentationName?: string;

  /** Custom Workflow span name. Defaults to "Workflow". */
  workflowSpanName?: string;

  /** Add active OTel IDs to durable log records. Defaults to true. */
  enrichLogger?: boolean;
}
```

Provider selection is implicit:

- omit `tracerProviderFactory` to use the global provider;
- provide `tracerProviderFactory` to use the returned application-owned
  provider.

The default instrumentation scope name is
`aws-durable-execution-sdk-js`.

## Spans, Attributes, and Status

All plugin-created spans use `SpanKind.INTERNAL`.

- **Workflow:** Named by `workflowSpanName`, which defaults to `Workflow`.
  Carries `durable.execution.arn` and, when terminal,
  `durable.execution.status`.
- **Invocation:** Named `Invocation`. Carries `durable.execution.arn`,
  `durable.invocation.first`, and `durable.invocation.status`.
- **Operation:** Named from the configured operation name, or the operation
  type when unnamed. Carries `durable.execution.arn`,
  `durable.operation.id`, `durable.operation.type`, optional
  `durable.operation.name`, and optional `durable.operation.subtype`.
  `InvocationOtelPlugin` sets `durable.operation.status=STARTED` at span
  creation; both plugins apply a supplied terminal operation status at
  completion. `durable.attempt.number` is added to `STEP` and
  `WAIT_FOR_CONDITION` operation spans when supplied.
- **Attempt:** Named `<operation name or type> attempt <number>`. Carries the
  operation identity attributes, `durable.attempt.number`, and terminal
  `durable.attempt.outcome`. Attempt spans do not carry
  `durable.operation.status`.

For `ExecutionOtelPlugin` with an application-owned provider, Invocation also
adds `cloud.resource_id` and `faas.max_memory` when the corresponding Lambda
environment values are available.

OpenTelemetry status mapping is:

| Span       | Durable result                                                     | OTel status              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Workflow   | `SUCCEEDED` / `FAILED`                                             | `OK` / `ERROR`           |
| Invocation | `SUCCEEDED` or `PENDING` / `FAILED` / `RETRYING`                   | `OK` / `ERROR` / `UNSET` |
| Operation  | `SUCCEEDED` / error object / other failure without an error object | `OK` / `ERROR` / `UNSET` |
| Attempt    | `FAILED` / any other outcome                                       | `ERROR` / `OK`           |

Operation and attempt errors are recorded as exception events when an error
object is available. Workflow and Invocation failures set an `ERROR` status and
status message without recording an exception event.

## Log Correlation

When `enrichLogger` is enabled, durable log records receive the currently
active OpenTelemetry `traceId`, `spanId`, and `otelTraceSampled` values.
Outside an active span, no fields are added.

Disable enrichment when another logging integration already injects equivalent
fields:

```typescript
const plugin = new ExecutionOtelPlugin({
  enrichLogger: false,
});
```

For `ExecutionOtelPlugin`, handler-level logs correlate with Workflow. For
`InvocationOtelPlugin`, handler-level logs correlate with Invocation. Logs
inside child contexts and attempts correlate with their active operation or
attempt span.

## Public API

### Plugins

```typescript
new ExecutionOtelPlugin(config?: OtelPluginConfig);
new InvocationOtelPlugin(config?: OtelPluginConfig);
```

### Provider Types

```typescript
type IdGeneratorFactory = (fallbackIdGenerator?: IdGenerator) => IdGenerator;

type TracerProviderFactory = (
  createIdGenerator: IdGeneratorFactory,
) => TracerProvider;
```

### `DeterministicIdGenerator`

An OpenTelemetry `IdGenerator` with `AsyncLocalStorage`-scoped deterministic
overrides. `withIds()` applies optional trace and span IDs only while its
synchronous callback starts a span. The span ID override is consumed after its
first use. All other ID generation delegates to the fallback generator.

```typescript
const generator = new DeterministicIdGenerator(fallbackIdGenerator);

const span = generator.withIds(
  { traceId: executionTraceId, spanId: deterministicSpanId },
  () => tracer.startSpan("operation"),
);
```

### ID Helpers

```typescript
deriveTraceIdFromArn(
  executionArn: string,
  executionStartTimestamp?: Date,
): string;

deriveTraceIdFromXRayRoot(xRayRoot: string): string | undefined;

deriveWorkflowSpanId(executionArn: string): string;

deriveExecutionRootSpanId(executionArn: string): string;

deriveSpanIdFromOperationId(
  operationId: string,
  executionArn: string,
): string;
```

`deriveTraceIdFromArn` returns a 32-character hexadecimal trace ID.
`deriveTraceIdFromXRayRoot` converts a valid X-Ray `Root` value to an
OpenTelemetry trace ID and returns `undefined` for invalid input.
`deriveWorkflowSpanId` hashes `workflow:<execution ARN>`,
`deriveExecutionRootSpanId` hashes `execution-root:<execution ARN>` (a distinct
namespace so the synthetic root never collides with the Workflow or operation
spans on the shared trace), and `deriveSpanIdFromOperationId` hashes
`<execution ARN>:<operation ID>`. All three span helpers return 16-character
hexadecimal IDs.

### Context Extractors

```typescript
xRayContextExtractor(info: InvocationInfo): ContextExtractorResult;
w3cClientContextExtractor(info: InvocationInfo): ContextExtractorResult;
```

The package also exports the `ContextExtractor`, `ContextExtractorResult`,
`IdGeneratorFactory`, `TracerProviderFactory`, and `OtelPluginConfig` types.

## Verification and Troubleshooting

After deployment:

1. Invoke a durable function with multiple steps or a wait/resume cycle.
2. Verify Invocation spans and completed operation spans appear after enabled
   invocations.
3. Verify one Workflow span appears after the execution becomes terminal.
4. Expect the Workflow span, every Invocation span, and the operation/attempt
   spans to share one execution trace ID.
5. Confirm the documented cross-links connect the workflow and invocation views.
6. Confirm unrelated root spans retain provider-generated trace IDs.
7. Verify durable log records contain correlation fields when
   `enrichLogger` is enabled.

If no plugin spans appear:

- confirm a compatible SDK provider is registered before invocation start, or
  return one through `tracerProviderFactory`;
- confirm the provider has a span processor and exporter;
- check for the plugin warning that says telemetry was disabled because the
  global tracer was incompatible;
- remember that dynamic loading supports only the global-provider path;
- remember that Workflow is not exported until `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`.

One execution trace is expected. The Workflow span and every per-invocation
Invocation span share it, anchored at the execution ancestor (the propagated
remote parent, or a synthetic execution root).
