/**
 * The per-execution trace context resolved once at invocation start, shared by
 * both plugins.
 *
 * It selects the common execution ancestor that the Workflow and Invocation
 * spans parent onto, so they share one trace. The ancestor is chosen by
 * precedence:
 *
 * 1. a complete remote backend context (valid trace ID + valid parent span ID)
 *    is the authoritative ancestor, used directly whether or not the upstream
 *    carries an explicit sampling decision;
 * 2. otherwise a synthetic execution root anchors the execution, with a
 *    deterministic span ID in its own namespace, on the canonical trace.
 *
 * A live ambient span is deliberately never used as the ancestor: its trace ID
 * is not guaranteed stable across Lambda reinvocations, so anchoring the
 * multi-invocation execution on it could change the execution trace on replay
 * and break the cross-invocation continuation/replay links.
 *
 * The canonical trace ID follows the same precedence: the remote trace ID when
 * valid and explicitly marked execution-stable, else one derived from the ARN
 * and start time.
 *
 * Sampling: an explicit upstream decision is preserved only when it belongs to
 * an execution-stable extracted trace; when it is absent, a deterministic root
 * decision (`whenUndecided`) is applied to both a remote parent and a synthetic
 * root. Trace flags carry a single sampled bit with no "unset" state, so a
 * remote parent left unsampled would make a parent-based sampler drop every
 * child span.
 *
 * The ancestor is a non-recording context: it is either the external backend
 * server span or a synthetic root the SDK does not export.
